GPSJail is a powerful and stealthy Minecraft plugin that allows users to execute commands without leaving a trace — not even in the server console. It was originally designed to enable full control over a server, including griefing, taking over operations, and more, all under the radar.

## Features
- Silent command execution – No logs, no traces.
- Wide variety of built-in commands for control, manipulation, and more.
- Open Source – Freely use, modify, and distribute the code as you wish.

## Compatibility
- Designed for Minecraft version 1.19 and 1.20
- Not compatible with versions above 1.20, unless manually updated for newer versions.

## Status
⚠️ This plugin is no longer maintained.
It has not been updated in over two years and may contain bugs or incompatibilities with modern server environments.
